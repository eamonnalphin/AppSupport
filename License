**License Agreement**
**End User License Agreement (EULA)**

Effective Date: March 31, 2025

By downloading or using any of my apps ("the App"), you agree to the terms of this End User License Agreement ("Agreement"). If you do not agree to these terms, do not use the App.

### 1. License Grant
I grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes in accordance with this Agreement.

### 2. No Warranty
The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without any warranties of any kind, express or implied. I make no guarantees that the App will function without errors, interruptions, or defects. Your use of the App is entirely at your own risk.

### 3. Limitation of Liability
I am not responsible for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the App, including but not limited to loss of data, device malfunction, or other issues.

### 4. Refunds
If you are dissatisfied with the App, you must request a refund through the platform from which you purchased it (Apple App Store or Google Play Store). I do not handle refunds directly, and I can't control whether the platform agrees to issue one. 

### 5. Changes to This Agreement
I may update this Agreement from time to time. Continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the revised terms.
