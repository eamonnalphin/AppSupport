*Privacy Policy*

Updated Mar 31, 2025

Since my website is currently down, here's a summary of my privacy policy.
tldr; I dont collect your data, I wouldn't know what to do with it. 


Effective Date: March 31, 2025

I'm committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how I handle user data.

### Information I Collect
I do not collect, store, or share any personal data. The only information we receive is crash reports, which are automatically provided by the respective app stores (Apple App Store and Google Play Store). These reports may contain anonymized diagnostic data to help me improve my Apps performance and stability.

### How I Use Crash Data
Crash data is used solely for troubleshooting and enhancing the App. I do not use this data for any other purposes, and it is not shared with third parties.

### Third-Party Services
I do not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services. The only data received is through Apple and Googleâ€™s built-in crash reporting systems.

### Your Rights
Since I do not collect any personal information, there is no data for you to request, modify, or delete. However, if you have any concerns, you can contact me at JustDabblingApps@gmail.com.

### Changes to This Policy
I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted here or on my website eamonnalphin.ca.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at JustDabblingApps@gmail.com.
